## **Introducing Simple Auths! ✨📘**

**You can download it here:** https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-auths

Simple Auths is a small utility mod that implements a registration and login system for servers, and also implements control tools for multi-accounts by ip.

Simple Auths performs all these actions thanks to its integration with MySQL databases usually offered by minecraft hostings. Also implements some administrative functions for op users or administrators. Allowing un-register accounts by ip or by username, or setting some limits on what an unregistered person can do.

This project is still in active development, we are fixing bugs and improving functionality.

We are upgrading this project but there are only a few people on the project, so updates take a lot of time.
